Given that the output shape remains unchanged at (None, 8, 4, 82, 51, 3) despite the adjustments, we need to explore a different approach to ensure the width dimension is correctly upscaled to 102. The model's current structure seems to have a persistent issue with correctly restoring the width dimension.

Revised Approach for Decoder:
The decoder needs to specifically target the width dimension for upsampling. Since standard UpSampling3D and Conv3D layers haven't achieved the desired result, a custom approach might be necessary.

One possible solution is to use a combination of Reshape and Conv3D layers to manually adjust the width dimension:

Reshape and Adjust Width: After the initial upsampling, reshape the tensor and use a Conv3D layer to expand the width.
Final Upsampling and Convolution: Perform the final adjustments to match the input shape.
Here's a revised decoder structure:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Reshape, Conv3D, UpSampling3D, BatchNormalization, Activation, Add, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import tensorflow as tf

# Custom Reshape Layer to Adjust Width
class CustomReshape(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, target_shape):
        super(CustomReshape, self).__init__()
        self.target_shape = target_shape

    def call(self, input):
        reshaped = tf.reshape(input, self.target_shape)
        return reshaped

# Decoder
x = UpSampling3D((1, 2, 2))(encoded)  # Upsample spatial dimensions (height and width)
x = resnet_block(x, 64)

# Custom reshape and Conv3D to adjust width
x = CustomReshape((-1, 8, 4, 82, 51, 64))(x)  # Adjust the batch size and channels as needed
x = Conv3D(64, (1, 1, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', strides=(1, 1, 2))(x)

x = resnet_block(x, 32)

# Final Conv3D layer to adjust the channels and ensure the shape matches the original input
decoded = Conv3D(3, (3, 3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same')(x)

autoencoder = Model(inputs, decoded)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
